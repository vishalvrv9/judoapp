# judoapp

This is a ReactJS SPA which showcases some Judo olympians and their medal history. Recent updated datasets and player new players to be added soon.

I am absolutely new to whatever I've achieved here. (help appreciated)
I can only run the app on my localhost:3000 expressjs server as of now but I'm currently working on publishing it @ github pages/heroku/surge etc.

Minimum requirements:
You need to have node.js and npm installed in your system.
 
Steps: 
Clone this repository using git clone http://www.github.com/vishalvrv9/judoapp

Run into this directory using the bash (cmd for windows) and type:

NODE_ENV=production node_modules/.bin/babel-node --presets react,es2015 src/server.js (for ubuntu)

and 

.... (for windows)

and go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser (firefox/chrome preferred)
